## Project: MyMods

MyMods is a desktop mod tracking application used for tracking mods in NUS.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to change themes of GUI.
  * What it does: Allow user to switch between dark and light mode easily.
  * Justification: The purpose of the dark and light mode is to let users use light mode in the day while dark mode at
  night so users can adapt to the lighting of day.
  * Credits: *{css file is adopted from AB3 from https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/tp wih light(newly created) and
  dark(modified) themed css file suited to our application}*
